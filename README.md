# Introduction

This is an educational implementation of HyperLogLog algorithm based directly on 

Flajolet et al., "HyperLogLog: the analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm", DMTCS proc. AH 2007, http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf

For production use it may be wiser to use https://github.com/Microsoft/CardinalityEstimation
They implement optimized version of HyperLogLog++ algorithm. It is more complex, thus harder to understand and analyze.
